### My entry for the fabulous [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) ###

- I tried to spend as little time as possible on the solutions so don't expect the best code in the world.
- Global leaderboard is not a goal as I am just too lazy to wake up that early every morning. Private ones are another matter ;) 
- I usually try to keep my solution in one file as it's easier to share and explain like that.
- The IntcodeComputer class is an exception to that rule. It was created as soon as I realised it's used in every other puzzle and been updated with new requirements, so it's very much of an overkill for some of the tasks. Been fun to maintain backwards compatibility though.
- Feel free to copy, you shameless cheater!
